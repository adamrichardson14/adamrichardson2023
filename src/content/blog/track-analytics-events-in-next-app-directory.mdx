## Introduction

For all of you not only trying out the new Next.js 13 app folder, but brave enough to go to production, you will need some analytics!

Lots of analytics libraries will use **router.events,** which is not supported by the **useRouter** imported from **next/navigation**

### Previous React Hook

Previously I had this simple hook, which would log pages

```jsx
import * as Fathom from "fathom-client";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const useFathom = () => {
	const router = useRouter();

	useEffect(() => {
		if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
			Fathom.load(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID, {
				includedDomains: ["adamrichardson.dev", "www.adamrichardson.dev"],
			});
		}

		function onRouteChangeComplete() {
			Fathom.trackPageview();
		}

		router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);

		return () => {
			router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", onRouteChangeComplete);
		};
	}, [router.events]);
};
```

### What it looks like now

The two hooks that we need to use are only available in client components. I created a simple component you can import into the root layout, which will track all of your page views

```jsx
/* eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps */
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import * as Fathom from "fathom-client";

export default function Analytics({}) {
  const id = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID as string;
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  useEffect(() => {
    Fathom.load(id, {
      includedDomains: ["adamrichardson.dev", "www.adamrichardson.dev"],
    });

    let newPageViewPath: string | undefined;

    if (pathname) {
      newPageViewPath = pathname + searchParams.toString();
      Fathom.trackPageview({
        url: newPageViewPath,
        referrer: document.referrer,
      });
    }
  }, [pathname, searchParams]);

  return <></>;
}
```

You can see this component is just returning a fragment. It’s a client component that we will insert into the root layout.

**********\*\*\*\***********useEffect()**********\*\*\*\*********** is being used here which is going to rerun the code if the pathname or searchParams changes.

### Root layout

This is for my website, which I’ve just updated to Next.js 13. Here is the root layout
